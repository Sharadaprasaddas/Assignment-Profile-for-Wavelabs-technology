International Journal on  (Sliding Mode Control : An approach to modify the dynamics of Non Linear System)
ABSTRACT: The presence of uncertainties and disturbances in dynamic control system is a common problem to deal 
with when considering real plants. The effect of these uncertainties on the system dynamics should be carefully taken 
into account in the controller design. Considerable progresses have been attained in robust control techniques, such as 
nonlinear adaptive control, model predictive control, back stepping, sliding model control and others. The Sliding 
Mode Control (SMC) technique turns out to be characterized by high simplicity and robustness. Essentially, 
discontinuous control laws are utilized by SMC to drive the system state trajectory onto a specified surface in the state 
space, the so called sliding or switching surface. In order to achieve the control objective, the control input must be 
designed to overcome the uncertainties and the disturbances acting on the system. The main advantages of this 
approach are of two type, one while the system is on the sliding manifold it behaves as a reduced order system with 
respect to the original plantandthe other one is dynamic of the system while in sliding mode is insensitive to model 
uncertainties and disturbances. This work analyses a quite recent development of sliding mode control, namely the 
second order sliding mode approach, which is unexpectedly face a growing attention in the control research community. 
The objective of this project is to survey the theoretical background of sliding mode control, in particular higher order 
sliding mode control, to show that the second order sliding mode approach is an effective solution.
